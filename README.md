# BGSU-Thread-Synchronization
This is a lab from BGSU's Operating System course, which has several producer functions write randomly generated numbers to a gloablly created buffer,
and then consumer functions receive these numbers through the buffer. The goal is to show thread synchronization and prevent process deadlock.
Language used: C++
